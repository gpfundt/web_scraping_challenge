# web_scraping_challenge

In this project I made a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. I use BeautifulSoup, Pythohn Pandas, and Requests/Splinter to get the information in a useable format and then I use MongoDB with Flask to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information.
